# Winetastr – notes for working in this repo

- Code, file names, routes and comments in English. The UI is Danish, English and Icelandic (`src/i18n`).
- Astro static site on Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploys from `main`); Pages Functions in `functions/api/`.
- Supabase: access is enforced in the database (RLS for hosts, security-definer RPCs keyed by invite code for guests).
  Keep a copy of every applied migration in `supabase/migrations/`.
- After every database change, run `supabase/tests/security.sql` (it rolls back) and expect `security test passed`.
